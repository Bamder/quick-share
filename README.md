# quick-share
## Introduction
QuickShare is a web project based on a Python back-end, which is aimed at transmitting files from one to one/more via P2P pattern.
As we design, it is used in the situations - a lecture, a presentation, a meeting, an exhibition, and even a temporary cooperation - where there is a need for quick and temporary file-transmission without adding each others' WeChat friends or uploading files onto a cloud storage.

## Security and Privacy
The transmission channel is protected with TLS/Https pattern, and the files are all encrypted during the P2P transmission. We only save the meta data of connection and shared files on the server besides the minimum essential data to sustain the function of QuickShare.
